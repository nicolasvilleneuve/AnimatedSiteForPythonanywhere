## Description 
This website uses Django for the backend, Node.js, three.js, html and css for the frontend and sqlite3 for the database. To see it in action, I have deployed it at the following link:

https://nicvilleneuve.pythonanywhere.com/

It is meant to serve as my new portfolio website, showing I've got the chops to be a good full stack developer.

It is best experienced when scrolled through slowly.

## Usage 
You can access the website itself trhough the link provided above (https://nicvilleneuve.pythonanywhere.com/). 
I have uploaded to the entire project to github so, if this website inspires you to do something similar, and you need a jumping off point, you can find the files that matter at the following path: AnimatedSiteForPythonanywhere/portfoliosite/viteproject/static/src/dist/bundle.js/

## Contributing

If the changes are to be major, however, please open an issue first so we can discuss if/what you would like to change.
