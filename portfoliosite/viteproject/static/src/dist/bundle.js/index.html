        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> I am a recent MSc graduate, where I studied an emerging field of data science (metabolomics) </p>
        <p> In the course of my studies, I found a passion for creating things with programming  </p>
      </section>

      <section class="left">
        <h2> Skills </h2>
        <h3> Python </h3>
          <p> I initially learned python to make use of pandas, numpy and matplotlib to generate and harness machine learning models,
              process, clean, and visualize my metabolomics dataset. Along the way, I decided to devote at least an hour a day to engineering a project, for 100 days straight.
              As a result, I have become extremely comfortable with python and object-oriented programming. Additionally, it has paved the way
              to me discovering my passion for full-stack development.
          </p>
        <h3> SQL </h3>
          <p> I enjoy using all kinds of SQL, though postgreSQL is my favourite, and I have the most experience with SQLite3.
            I have been using it for 2 years, so as to be able to make and manage functional databases when creating servers with the Flask or Django framework.
            Additonally, I have exeperience utilizing several forms of SQL to control/utilize relational database systems which sometimes contain millions of rows.
        </p>
        <h3> JS </h3>
          <p> I have been working with JS for 2 years, so as to execute scripts to apply machine learning models to my
            raw spectral dataset in MZMine, through a unix Biocluster. Additionally, I have utilized it (Node.js and Three.js) to provide all of the functionality of this website. As you may therefore be able to tell, I learn quickly. </p>
        <h3> HTML5 </h3>
          <p> I have worked with HTML5 for > 1 year and I utilized HTML5 to form the foundation of more than 20 websites.
          </p>
        <h3> CSS3 </h3>
          <p> I have utilized CSS3 for > 1 year. I utilized CSS3 to stylize this and an excess of 20 websites.
          </p>
        <h3> R </h3>
          <p> R is the gold-standard programming language for academia. As such, I have been an avid user of R for 4+ years.
              My interest in R for statistical analyses, machine learning and data visualization began whilst I was conducting my honours research thesis.
              During the course of my MSc, I have trained and utilized machine learning models varying in complexity using datasets from Kaggle, ISLR and the UCI ML Repository (as well as my own dataset).
